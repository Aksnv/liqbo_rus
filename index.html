            <p>Now you have a <a href="#" class="inline-link inline-link--offering">unique opportunity</a> to be involved in the foundation of a new global loyalty ecosystem, driven by buyers, rather than by retail networks and loyalty alliances. Only the modern customer-oriented approach can lead the market to a new horizon in terms of attractiveness, usability and gross turnover.</p>
            <h2>Over $48 Billion Worth of Consumer Loyalty Reward Points Dispensed Each Year in the US alone, Yet One-Third Are Never Cashed In</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Out of roughly $48 billion worth of perceived value in reward points and miles American businesses issue annually, at least one-third, representing $16 billion in value, goes unredeemed by consumers, according to the study, titled 2011 Forecast of U.S. Consumer Loyalty Program Points Value. (The 2011 study from SWIFT EXCHANGE and COLLOQUY)</p>
          <aside>Expensive to roll-out and operate, using a limited time / limited coverage, non-convertible utilities enabling very narrow possibilities for retail customers, built as self-sufficient and isolated from each other thus making redemption process tricky and requiring special customer’s attention, conventional loyalty programs and coalitions keep facing serious obstacles on their way to a truly global coverage and ubiquitous frictionless use.</aside>
          <p>According to the COLLOQUY’s biennial report on the scope of U.S. customer rewards programs "American households hold memberships in 29 loyalty programs spread among the retail, financial services, travel and various other economic sectors, but are active in just 12 of them. The corresponding household membership figures in the 2013 census were 22 and nine." According to 2011 COLLOQUY Loyalty Census study “Out of roughly $48 billion worth of perceived value in reward points and miles American businesses issue annually, at least one-third, representing $16 billion in value, goes unredeemed by consumers”</p>
          <p>The <span class="inline-marker">Liquid Bonus® Loyalty Aggregation Medium</span> directly addresses this by sharing of the widely adopted economy model of conventional loyalty programs with additional economic incentive that allows users to collect the LiqBo® Tokens from different loyalty market players and easily ‘monetize’ them by rewarding at their next purchase elsewhere. By implementing of the Liquid Bonus® Medium we strive for a much lower cost than the current business models of centralized loyalty programs can reach and much higher throughput rate and performance than the current open Blockchain networks allow.</p>

            <h1>Interoperable Loyalty Token</h1>
          </header>
          <p>In order to unify the application and erase the circulation boundaries for reward points, miles and other proprietary utilities, the interoperable Liquid Bonus® or LiqBo® Token has been introduced. LiqBo® Token is the utility token aimed for abstracting from (sometimes replacing of) points, stamps, miles and other valued legacy bonus points. Thus every customer shall be able to get LiqBo® Tokens as reward in the context of any existing loyalty program or even from a standalone shop and exchange them for discounts at any point of sale that is ready to accept LiqBo® Tokens.</p>
          <aside>Thanks to its core Blockchain infrastructure, the Liquid Bonus® Loyalty Aggregation Medium with its interoperable LiqBo® Token shall give a new breath to the global loyalty business model thus bringing loyalty programs’ penetration to a new high level.</aside>
          <p class="article-image"><img src="images/liqbo.gif"></p>
          <p>If we examine the loyalty programs’ attractiveness for the customers by classifying them according to program design and redemption options, then the absolute leadership shall be given to coalition loyalty programs having cash back or direct rebate options available for consumers. In addition to it, the special buyers’ attention is always paid to a gift option, getting earnings at someone's store and redemption at another's and other bonus circulation options.</p>
          <aside>In addition to it, we consider as a very important indicator and clear landmark the fact that American Airlines' report in 2006 stated that the airline earned more from selling Advantage miles to its partners, like Citibank, than it did selling airline tickets. Thus, the willingness for the turnover of bonuses was confirmed in practice more than 10 years ago!</aside>
          <p>The Liquid Bonus® Loyalty Aggregation Medium directly addresses this by sharing of the adopted economy model of conventional loyalty programs while providing an economic incentive that allows users to collect their LiqBo® Tokens from different loyalty market players and easily ‘monetize’ them by rewarding at their next purchase elsewhere. Moreover, acquirers and(or) owners of the LiqBo® Tokens not only have an opportunity to get and reward them at any time, but also in the event of a long non-use of accumulated stake, they may increase their "bonus savings" due to the market growth of the LiqBo® Token’s value. So we hope that in the near future collected bonus points and miles will not be considered as a limited-usage expiring tools but rather as a liquid and profitable assets.</p>

            <h2>The Early Bird Programm</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Our Early Bird Program is aimed for the Liquid Bonus® Medium and LiqBo® Token proof of concept finalization. We would also like to locate and establish our strong relationships with preferred partners and strategic contributors at this stage. Duration of the Early Bird Program will depend on how much our concept will be well received by the market and how quickly we can close our need for strategic partner(s) and contributor(s). We expect that it will not exceed one month. Please do not hesitate to address any questions or inquiries by phone <span class="inline-marker">+31 20 808 4772</span> or by email at <a href="mailto:marketing@finstick.net" class="inline-link">marketing@finstick.net</a></p>
          <aside>The Early Bird Program is the unique opportunity for everyone to acquire LiqBo® Tokens in exchange to a great job contributed during pre-ICO and ICO stage. Every role, its value and corresponding stake of LiqBo® Tokens shall be settled before the end of the Early Bird Program. Any and all contributors registered during the Early Bird Program period will be granted their exceptional 10% discount from the LiqBo® Token’s pre-ICO value thus only Early Bird contributors will be able to get the maximum possible discount (over 20%) on LiqBo® Token.</aside>
          <p>In order to become an Early Bird contributor, you shall <a href="#" class="inline-link">submit an application form</a> for the Early Bird Whitelist. This is mandatory step for getting the maximum discount. We would like to know who our strategic contributors are and how they would like to participate in the Liquid Bonus® ecosystem.</p>

            <h1>Double your token stake after ICO!</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Every «Early Bird» donor transferring a non-refundable amount to our wallet shall double the resulting stake of LiqBo Tokens. We will targeted use the accumulated funds to prepare and run the ICO (marketing, conferences, publications and advertising, as well as payment for contractors and freelancers). In this case, we do not guarantee the return of collected donations in any way in case of failure on the ICO (full refund is not applicable for the program’s «Early Bird» donors).</p>
          <aside><strong>What we guarantee:</strong><br> - report on the amount of raised funds and their expenditure and<br> - the distribution of a two-fold number of LiqBo Tokens on the amount of donations made during the «Early Bird» program. That is, if you would have transferred a donation of 0.5 Ethereum (ETH) and the estimated ICO value of one LiqBo® Token is ETH 0.001, then no later than 7 days after the successful closing of the ICO, the person who would have made this donation will be distributed free of charge (0.5 / 0.001) X2 = 1000 LiqBo® tokens.</ul>
          </aside>
          <p>We reserve the right to stop the described process of collecting «Early Bird» donations at any time and without explaining our reasons. All raised funds will have to be directed to preparing and launching of the ICO. Neither wages nor bonus costs for our employees and (or) the founders are not on the agenda! All raised funds, which will not be spent on ICO, will be returned to donors in proportion to their contributions.</p>

            <h2><a href="#">As a Loyalty Provider, why should I take part in creation and operation of another system, if I can proceed with conversion using a national currency?</a></h2>
            <div class="qa__item-content">
              <p>This is a very reasonable question. The answer stands behind the economy model. The whole Liquid Bonus® Loyalty Aggregation Medium is based on the inexpensive Blockchain technology and supported by Smart Contract functionality. Thus every single loyalty provider can decide if this time operational margin is mainly targeted & transaction fee must be set to its maximum value, or it may be set to a lower value or even zeroed for optimized offering. For the case when traditional banking settlement is applied for either conversion of bonus points to a national currency or an inter-loyalty clearance (conversion from one loyalty medium to another), any loyalty provider or consumer will have to cover much more expensive and mandatory transaction fee set by a 3d Party (bank or exchange) thus remaining out of loyalty provider’s control and making no impact on loyalty providers’ revenue growth.</p>

            <h2><a href="#">Why do you think that most of loyalty programs & service providers shall be interested?</a></h2>
            <div class="qa__item-content">
              <p>We believe that the immediate involvement of major loyalty market players is a controversial thing. Nevertheless, taking into account the great potential of the blockchain technology together with analysis of what has happened and is happening to financial markets and crypto-currencies, we are sure that after a certain period of time required for adoption and determining the most appropriate way of using it for the sake of loyalty systems’ evolution, vendors, loyalty networks and coalitions will certainly discover numerous benefits from using it together with new opportunities for further development</p>

          <p>I had portfolio companies with stellar teams, and I was disappointed when they didn’t push the pedal on marketing or sales. I argued with co-investors, making the case that awesome partnership deals take time to put together, so kickstarting the effort early was essential, even before the product was ready for primetime.</p>
          <p>The counterargument was, in the world of software, the product is your “funnel.” The problem with great marketing is that it will hide the leaks in that funnel, fooling you into believing the hype around your vanity metrics.</p>
